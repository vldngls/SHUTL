# üöå Integrated Smart Shuttle System

Welcome to the **Integrated Smart Shuttle System** project! This project, developed by **Vlyde Angeles**, **Dolcielo Fuentes**, and **Lebrone Sacman** from **DLSU-D**, is built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Our goal is to create a smart, efficient, and reliable shuttle tracking system for Camella Daang Hari, operated by MEx, a leading transportation company in the Philippines.

## üìú Abstract

Camella Daang Hari's dynamic shuttle system, operated by MEx, a nation-wide transportation company established in 2008, has quirks that lead to inefficiencies and unpredictability affecting commuters. This study proposes developing an Integrated Smart Shuttle System to tackle these issues and enhance both efficiency and reliability. By incorporating real-time GPS tracking and advanced communication platforms, the system will improve communication between shuttles and passengers, provide timely and accurate notifications, and streamline commutes and shuttle operations. These upgrades will not only reduce unpredictability and increase accessibility for commuters but also support MEx employees by optimizing operational workflows. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the overall commuter experience and optimize Camella's transportation network.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time GPS Tracking**: Live location updates of shuttles.
- **Advanced Communication**: Improved communication channels between shuttles and passengers.
- **Timely Notifications**: Alerts and notifications for shuttle schedules and delays.
- **Operational Optimization**: Streamlined processes for MEx employees to manage shuttle operations.
